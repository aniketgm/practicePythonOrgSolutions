# Practice Python Org Solutions

## Overview

There is a website called practicepython.org by [Michele Pratusevich](http://www.practicepython.org/about/), which consists of some good
exercises for practicing python programming. I've been solving the exercises for a while now and thought to have them store in here.
So that I can access and update them from anywhere I can. This repo consists of solutions to the exercises on that site.

That's it Folks!!

Check out the [Solutions](Solutions) folder for the solutions. Thanks. Peace out !!
